1. Project Overview

Good4U is a lightweight, anonymous social media platform where users post positive moments from their lives. Other anonymous users can “cheer” (like) posts to encourage positivity. There are no profiles, no comments, and no follower graphs — the app is intentionally simple, uplifting, and low‑pressure.

The core experience is:

    Users open the app and immediately see a feed of positive posts.

    Users can submit their own positive moment.

    Users can cheer posts.

    Everything is anonymous, tied only to a persistent device‑level anonymous ID.

The app should feel:

    Soft, warm, and encouraging.

    Minimalistic and frictionless.

    Fast and realtime.
